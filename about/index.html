          <p>Brightway was established to address a documented gap: Canadian universities provide essential academic and administrative support, but lack the resources for ongoing, personalized welfare monitoring that international families expect.</p>
          <p>Our approach combines professional expertise with cultural understanding. We maintain structured protocols for safety, communication, and accountability—while recognizing that effective guardianship requires human connection and cultural fluency.</p>
