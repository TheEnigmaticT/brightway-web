          <h2 id="mission-title">Ensuring safety, comfort, and personal growth through culturally-aware support.</h2>
          <p>International students deserve more than paperwork guardianship. They need someone who understands the cultural context, speaks their language, and shows up when it matters. Brightway exists to bridge the gap between families at home and students finding their footing abroad.</p>

        <div class="founder-story" data-reveal>
          <p>After serving the City of Toronto for more than 31 years as a police officer—retiring at the rank of Staff Sergeant and spending seven of those years as a criminal investigator—Dave Murray developed a deep understanding of safety, community support, and the challenges people face when they're far from home.</p>
          <p>Throughout his career, Dave saw firsthand how overwhelming a new country can feel, especially for young people navigating school, housing, and daily life without nearby family. That insight inspired him to create Brightway: a service dedicated to supporting international students in Canada and offering peace of mind to the parents who care about them.</p>
          <p>Brightway focuses on practical, everyday safety and well-being. Whether it's helping students recognize and avoid common scams, ensuring their housing is safe and properly inspected, or simply checking in when parents are worried—the goal is always the same: providing reassurance, guidance, and a trusted point of contact thousands of miles from home.</p>
          <p>Brightway isn't about fear; it's about comfort. It's about knowing that someone experienced, reliable, and compassionate is looking out for your child while they focus on their studies and build their future in a new country.</p>
