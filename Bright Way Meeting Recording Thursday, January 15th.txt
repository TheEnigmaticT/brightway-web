00:15 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: How you doing, Doug?
00:17 Doug Hochglaube: OK. I just want to make sure in the conversation that you had with Mark, it was 4 videos and how many articles per month.
00:24 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: I can go pull up the e-mail.
00:26 Doug Hochglaube: Just very quickly.

Text per week. In In organic content for. Red Red Note and then one video repurposed from Zhangxu and one new video. For WeChat, that was his his.
01:08 Doug Hochglaube: So sorry. Right. So is that 4 videos per month in total?
01:15 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: That would be, I mean, depending on the number of weeks, but eight right would be the number because one video for rednote and then one new video for WeChat every week. That's the plan he proposed. As I mean, I can let me share my screen rather than just try and dictate to you. Here the entire Here the entire screen the screen. So what? I had come back to him with was.
01:41 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: This This package. But he wanted for 1-2 and three a six month contract and I went no and then no ad management fee. If we're spending less than 5 grand.
01:59 Doug Hochglaube: OK, sorry, sorry. I'm just I'm sending a contract right now.
01:59 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: So that. OK.
02:04 Doug Hochglaube: So my my only question right now is for $2500 Canadian that includes 4 videos and how many articles per month was what you verbally agreed to.
02:07 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Right. So it includes, right? So this was like the the numbers were all done through e-mail. I can forward you the whole chain, but it was this package one and two and three, which means 4 videos for Red Note. Four different Four different videos for WeChat.
02:31 Doug Hochglaube: So hang on four videos and how many articles per month for rednote.
02:36 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Four, so four videos, four articles.

03:04 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Yeah. So just copying the videos from Reddit over. Yeah.
03:07 Doug Hochglaube: Red note Red Note videos per month. And that's And that's included. There's no additional cost.
03:15 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: So you guys have a video production fee?
03:17 Doug Hochglaube: How much?
03:20 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: I mean, he's asking for $1000. Production fee Production fee for each channel which struck me as quite high. And then he's also asking for a model fee of 100 CAD per session, which I presume is each month. Now I had not.
03:41 Doug Hochglaube: OK. Hang on a second sorry sorry
03:42 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: I I had said, yeah, yeah.
03:44 Doug Hochglaube: Sorry, sorry, sorry. I'm just. I'm I'm. I'm putting my lawyer's hat on, OK? So I'm just talking very factual.
03:49 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Right.
03:49 Doug Hochglaube: I'm gonna share my screen.
03:52 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Yes.
03:52 Doug Hochglaube: I don't need subcontracts, I just need data. What was agreed to.
03:54 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Gotcha. Well, right.
03:56 Doug Hochglaube: So.
03:57 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: So then what? I had said was.
03:58 Doug Hochglaube: Where? Where is it here?
04:00 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: And I'll forward you the e-mail.
04:02 Doug Hochglaube: Yeah.
04:02 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: But what I said was. A A flat $2500 a month for delivery, which means I had removed the model fees from this. I didn't say we had a model fee as well, so it was flat $2500 a month for what he offered in package one and two and three. I didn So no model fees in what I had discussed with him.
04:26 Doug Hochglaube: So let's just say so going back here, $2500 for video before articles per month.
04:30 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Yes. Yes.
04:33 Doug Hochglaube: For WeChat 4 new videos and for reposting of Red, I'll just put whatever Red Note videos per month.
04:39 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Yes, yes.
04:42 Doug Hochglaube: What would be a market friendly rate for that?
04:44 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: That's included. That's the same price.
04:49 Doug Hochglaube: Included.
04:50 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Yes.
04:51 Doug Hochglaube: And he's like, that's OK like he. So basically he's doing 8 videos per month for 2500 bucks.
04:57 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Yeah. Again, I do 12 for 1500. So I know this is not a bad rate.
05:02 Doug Hochglaube: Yes, I know, but he. But we're going to be using local talent.
05:07 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: I'm aware.
05:13 Doug Hochglaube: OK. And model monthly fees?
05:16 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Model monthly fee he's asking for. We didn't specify one way or the other here, right? If If he If he's paying If he's paying a model fee, I think it's fair that we pay it, which would be, he was saying $200.00 per session. I presume that means $200.00 a month.
05:38 Doug Hochglaube: Month. OK.
05:42 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: 'Cause it's. I mean, it's an hour's worth of work for that model, right? Maybe 2? That's gonna be quite a good rate for somebody in China.
05:49 Doug Hochglaube: Or local.
05:51 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Or local in Toronto. That's also not like 100 bucks an hour is not bad for Toronto or Vancouver for that matter, either.
05:59 Doug Hochglaube: Yeah. OK. Umm, so let me just highlight this. OK OK, OK. Go ahead.
06:20 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: That's it.
06:21 Doug Hochglaube: So I just wanted to just very quickly on on my end and then I'll let you, Trevor go for it. What would be helpful by the end of this month? So maybe in the next two weeks is that we finalize our website design.
06:35 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Yep.
06:35 Doug Hochglaube: To make To make sure that it's friendly for the Chinese market because some of the comments that we were getting
06:39 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Mm-hmm.
06:41 Doug Hochglaube: The comments that The comments that we were getting with our current website is that it's too institutional or looks like a university versus, you know, a concierge service provider. So if I go on. Where is it here? Umm. Modern concierge. Let me Let me just share my screen. Like I'm I'm just looking at concierge services irrespective of students or not right? So modern concierge, you know, this is their like, life unlimited. You have about personal, corporate, whatever the case is.
07:18 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Mm-hmm.
07:25 Doug Hochglaube: I mean, I kind of don't like this because it's like, OK. Just tell me what you do. But they have that.
07:30 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Yeah, but you're talking about the look, not the language. I get it.
07:33 Doug Hochglaube: Right, right. So where is it here? Like what we do? Handle hassles. Open the doors. Whatever the case is, then you have. My My God, what was the other one? It is services. Global there was one other one, a global one. This is a quintessentially. This is very well known.
08:06 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Gotcha.
08:08 Doug Hochglaube: But so obviously it's like here are the areas that they're operating in, right? But. You know what we do right? Signature Services, member services, whatever the case is.
08:23 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Hey there. So let me ask you, because we we brought this up before, right? You have an agency, I believe. Who did your website right?
08:31 Doug Hochglaube: Yes. And we so we sent them a template, we gave them some comments that you know obviously this is schooling. This is academics. But I don't think they're really hitting. They're they're not They're they're not making the right cake. They're not putting in the right ingredients. I'm not happy with the website design and.
08:50 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: OK.
08:54 Doug Hochglaube: And that's why I think And that's why I think you, Trevor with Catherine and even Kathy.
08:58 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Yeah.
09:00 Doug Hochglaube: 'Cause this my brain is overstretched.
09:03 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Yeah.
09:03 Doug Hochglaube: Here is let's figure out what is the right design. It needs to be professional, so it can't be too kiddish. It shouldn't look like it's like a U of T application web like, you know, McGill University website either. But it needs to be very professionally managed, very luxury oriented, because it's a higher fee.
09:23 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: I got you. I just dropped the site. I've worked with these guys a couple years ago. And they are private schools, so they're trying to get that luxury feeling across. They're obviously younger people than than who we're talking about, so don't be fooled by the 9 year olds, but I think they have. A some A. Some of the same notes around personalization. This feeling of each individual person matters, and the design is not quite. All the way where you want to go, but I think it's closer to where you want to go than your current site if your game. What I would do is let me create.
10:08 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: A A. Something that's, let's say, not quite all the way to quintessential. But But somewhere between where you are and quintessential for look and feel and language. And Catherine and I have been going back and forth a bit with the language. I'm finishing up a rewrite of it shortly. And then And then Creston School is OK. Yeah, that's. I know those folks too.
10:31 Doug Hochglaube: So So this is a. Yeah, this is a private school. You know, obviously the images could change, but I like the fact that over here it's very clearly laid out, right.
10:39 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Yeah, of course. Brilliant.
10:45 Doug Hochglaube: Why? Like why brightway about bright white? How to apply? We don't need, obviously, academics or charter in action or whatever, but we could say our programs right.
10:52 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Yeah, I get it. But totnab I get it. I like this a lot. This is a good look if you're cool with that, I will kind of use this as some of the reference and then we'll go rebuild from there.
11:03 Doug Hochglaube: Yeah. Like I like like point blank, our difference, which is like who are we and what's our difference against the other competitors, the other competitors as you know Trevor and I'll just say it one time for Kathy and Katherine is it's really just document processing, right immunization here.
11:07 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Yeah Yeah, yeah. Yes, you are way more than that.
11:21 Doug Hochglaube: Or, you know, we'll check in with a principal. But for us, it's the subtext. It's what's below that iceberg. Like what's below the water?
11:30 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Yeah.
11:30 Doug Hochglaube: You know what I mean? We provide so many We provide so many touch points there. You know, like key facts.
11:34 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: OK.
11:35 Doug Hochglaube: Like I like this are, you know, one experience or whatever the case is and you can have images and maybe their their actor images but images of like social networking, you know career networking. You know it could You know, it could be like a nurse with a student kind of thing, right?
11:53 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Yep.
11:54 Doug Hochglaube: Like it just shows some sort of images of of what we offer. And I like this apply for September 2026, right?
12:04 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: I I get it. They have a. They've got a good design language throughout the site and they've got a good message throughout the site. I like this a lot. OK, then I don't have any problem I can have.
12:14 Doug Hochglaube: Yeah. OK.
12:18 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: I mean probably A5 page site or something. I mean probably A5 page site or I mean probably A5 page site or something ready Ready for Tuesday if you want to look at a different version of this.
12:23 Doug Hochglaube: Sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fantastic.
12:26 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: OK, cool.
12:29 Doug Hochglaube: And just put like the key headers, you don't have to put the content like the copywriting. Just put the placeholder like. This is where the services are gonna go. This and then I'll be able to link everything together.
12:40 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: All right, cool. So I am. I have been pulling together from Catherine some ideas on the. Her her take on the site she's shared with me. Oh, I see there. You're in the corner. Hi, Catherine. Hi Catherine I Hi Catherine I didn't know I didn't know you were there. And she's all shared me some some resource videos on what she sees as effective video marketing. I I wanna I've I've taken them and done some transcription of them, but they're in there, in Chinese. So I'm trying to get, you know, speech to text and then text to English, which is a bit wonky, but I wanna come back with some recommendations for our our next Monday meeting at the marketing team and say, hey, like we're gonna know what type of content we.
13:25 Doug Hochglaube: OK.
13:26 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Wanna make and then we we are waiting on a phone. There's a company phone and then probably set up with a virtual phone number.
13:34 Doug Hochglaube: Yes.
13:37 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: So that we can give mark access to it and he can do the two factor authentication So that we can give Mark access to it and he can do the two factor authentication. Whatever might Whatever might be required for him to log in.
13:43 Doug Hochglaube: So hold that thought. So Yanina and Jinjing my old phone, which is still running.
13:46 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Yeah.
13:49 Doug Hochglaube: OK OK, we'll use that. It's what's my number. 647-208-4106, my right. Please tell me I'm right. So I don't feel old.
14:03 Dave Murray: You are old, Doug.
14:05 Doug Hochglaube: Oh, come on, come on. You didn't save me 208-4106. What did I say that when I close?
14:10 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: That's what you said. That's what you said.
14:12 Doug Hochglaube: Yeah
14:12 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: I've got the closed captions, we can prove it.
14:13 Doug Hochglaube: Yeah. Thank you. OK. OK. Bye. So 647-208-4106 is the number that we would use for brightwade.
14:23 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Well, now wait a minute. I bring this up because that's a real phone number, right?
14:28 Doug Hochglaube: Yes.
14:30 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: That means if Mark wants to connect to WeChat at 2:00 in the morning, he has to wake your *** up. To get the authentication number. You don't want that, so you set up a virtual phone number with a service like open phone and then you give him the login to open phone and then if he needs two factor authentication at 2:00 in the morning you can sleep easy because it's his problem to.
14:40 Doug Hochglaube: Uh-huh. OK.
14:53 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Actually get it?
14:53 Doug Hochglaube: I I'll just let you and Katherine figure that out then. No problem. OK. So wait, how do we do that then? How do we get this virtual phone? Driver recommend Driver recommend platform called pool.
15:07 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: I don't know how you pronounce their name they used to I don't know how you pronounce their name. They used to be called open phone, which was a really useful name, and now they're called quo quo a quo, I don't know.
15:17 Doug Hochglaube: OK.
15:17 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Qquo.com and they do a bunch of stuff, but they still do. The open phone service, which is pay them like $3 a month and get access to AUS or Canadian phone number that anybody who has the login and password can get phone. Calls and text from.
15:31 Doug Hochglaube: So you know what Yanina we should do that for Florida? So look into that for Florida. Catherine, can you send it to?
15:40 Jingjing Tan: Purchased a phone number virtual US phone number for Dori and he's using it.
15:48 Doug Hochglaube: Oh, great. OK.
15:48 Ianina Chliapnikov: Yep.
15:50 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: OK. So yes, it is. The easiest way I know of, and since I still have, I mean I don't live in the US anymore, but I still have most of my client base is out of there. Having AUS phone number that the IRS can call and complain to is also helpful.
16:06 Doug Hochglaube: Yeah, sounds good.
16:08 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: All right. So that website updates we've got, content is underway, but not yet. We're starting to film. You're finalizing contract for Mark today. You're going to get it his way.
16:20 Doug Hochglaube: Just I was waiting for you to make sure that that was there.
16:23 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: OK.
16:24 Doug Hochglaube: I'm gonna send that to mark the moment we get off.
16:26 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: OK. Do we have anything else pending? I do want to keep momentum up because we are. January is departing. We're already very nearly at the halfway point, and I want to get some content. Out Out and I mean get at least.
16:41 Doug Hochglaube: No the only thing that I wanna say is That I want to say is by the end of, by the end of February, I'm hoping that we start getting traction, meaning people are coming onto our website.
16:45 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Yeah.
16:55 Doug Hochglaube: They're they're They're they're asking requests for information and Dave, I know before the break, you're gonna come up with some webinar content. What's the update on that?
17:05 Dave Murray: I was coming up with webinar content.
17:08 Doug Hochglaube: Yeah.
17:09 Dave Murray: And you didn't ask? No, I didn't. I wasn't asked for webinar content.
17:14 Doug Hochglaube: Yes. Remember, we were going to do like 30 minute webinars. So you were just going to come up with with like topics to do those webinars and then we were going to fill in the content.
17:21 Dave Murray: Oh. Yeah, that was the the the life coach, the career coach with Jen.
17:30 Doug Hochglaube: Not the no. The webinar we're talking about.
17:34 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Are these four agencies 'cause?
17:35 Doug Hochglaube: People like the process. To.
17:36 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: I'll tell you what a student is not going to attend a webinar. Parent maybe, but a student will not.
17:41 Doug Hochglaube: No, we're looking more for the parents, right?
17:43 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: OK.
17:45 Doug Hochglaube: So in other words. Topics would have included and and Dave, you were gonna do this homework and send it to me, but it's what are the topics like when somebody's thinking about coming to Toronto? What do they wanna know? What's what What's what to do when they come to Toronto? Things like that, like basically Trevor, we wanted to create some sort of like, hey, we're we're hosting a webinar at the end of February to talk about what it's like. In your first three months of living in Toronto for first year university students, you know, like thought, leadership, type of thing.
18:18 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Yes.
18:20 Doug Hochglaube: So Dave, you were going to come up with a couple of ideas for that.
18:24 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: So let me ask.
18:24 Dave Murray: Work on it. It's.
18:28 Doug Hochglaube: Sorry, sharp. Go ahead.
18:29 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: What? What language are you gonna do this in? 'Cause, I would think particularly for the parents. OK Mandarin. Yeah. OK.
18:33 Doug Hochglaube: Well, Mandarin, if this was, if this was in China, we would do this in Mandarin.
18:37 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: I was wondering why OK.
18:37 Doug Hochglaube: But we would have the content. Like basically the the whole notion is is. How do you how how do we come across as a new company having thought leadership in this sector?
18:51 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Gotcha. So that a fair bit of that is going to be just pure content. I would note, right the the question then the kind of topics I'm looking at to talk to parents about are things like recognition of the GAO cow scores.
18:51 Doug Hochglaube: Right, that that was the idea. That was the spirit behind that.
19:07 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: You know You know what You know what tuition costs? What living costs are. You can obviously look up with calculators, but what's going to show up outside of just room books board, tuition fees? That a parent needs to consider. Are there scholarships? What's the study permit look like? Are there pathways to permanent residency from there? How is safety and discrimination on various neighborhoods like these sorts of questions?
19:31 Doug Hochglaube: Yeah, like these could be blogs that we could do. So maybe it's not a webinar. Maybe there are blogs?
19:36 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Well Well they're gonna be Well, they're gonna be. The intent is our short form content will be addressing a lot of these from both the parent and the student perspective, because we want them to see oh wow, bright way knows the answers to the questions I'm already worried about, and searching on these platforms for and then. Like Like the the the ability to have them aware of you depends on which of these topics is most interesting or interesting.
19:56 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Like the the the Most, I guess worrisome for them and the ones they're going to be most engaged on. Now you can do a webinar, but webinar is very B to B marketing and what people especially B to C want these days is what's called zero click content which is not go here sign up, wait four days and attend a thing. They've already they forgot about you. They forgot about everything. Life has moved on. It needs to be right now I have a question right now. I found the answer.
20:31 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Right now I understood Right now I understood how to do it. And maybe I began trusting the person who gave me that answer. So I'm going to be pushing us into that zero click content to get people just seeing our channel and putting some paid spend behind it to get people who aren't necessarily organically finding us still seeing our content.
20:41 Doug Hochglaube: Yeah. Right. So again, maybe it's just blogs that we could just post on our website and parents could like just read at their leisure.
21:04 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Blogs will help with SEO but again like video native and push stuff out into into Red Note text. Those are where you want to be because that is they don't even have to Click to come to your site. They saw it on the platform. OK cool.
21:08 Doug Hochglaube: Oh, for sure for sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
21:21 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Anything that we have forgotten to cover right now, otherwise I can get back into. Trying to figure out these Chinese videos and see how we wanna take them for inspiration for our content creation.
21:35 Doug Hochglaube: I think I'm good. So maybe Dave work with Catherine to look at some blogs that we can post.
21:43 Dave Murray: Yep.
21:45 Doug Hochglaube: OK, OK. Thanks Trevor.
21:46 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Yeah, cool. Thank you, Doug.
21:49 Dave Murray: Thanks guys.
21:49 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Thank you, Dina.
21:49 Jingjing Tan: However, one more thing like you need to confirm with Doug if he wants to be on the Monday call going forward or not.
21:52 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Thank you, Dave. Yes. Oh, good point. I think given how over committed and stretched you are, Doug. What I would like to do is make the Monday call. Jing Jing Katherine. Maybe Kathy and we will talk about specific marketing things. And every Wednesday we'll touch base with you and say this is what has happened this week. Do you have any thoughts or further things you want to toss in?
22:17 Doug Hochglaube: Exactly. And say here's what we've decided to do. That's it.
22:21 Trevor @ Crowdtamers: Yes, yes, all right. If you're cool with that, then jinjing, thanks for reminding me. We can make that happen.
