        <!-- Anna -->
        <article class="ambassador-profile" data-reveal>
          <div class="ambassador-profile-image pencil-sketch">
            <img src="/images/ambassador-anna.jpg" alt="Anna, Student Ambassador at University of Waterloo" />
          </div>
          <div class="ambassador-profile-content">
            <h3>Anna</h3>
            <p class="ambassador-meta">University of Waterloo · Computer Science · 3rd Year</p>
            <p class="ambassador-origin">Originally from Japan</p>

            <h4>Anna's Journey</h4>
            <p>I was born and raised in Japan until the end of elementary school. After that, I moved to the United States, where I was part of the robotics team for five years. That sparked my interest in programming and Computer Science. I chose the University of Waterloo because of its co-op program.</p>

            <h4>Why I Became an Ambassador</h4>
            <p>I took part in the initial planning of Crestway Global, and I thought it would be a great way to help students like me who are away from home for the first time feel connected to their new community.</p>

            <h4>Biggest Challenge</h4>
            <p>Food and diet. The dorm cafeteria was convenient, but it wasn't the same as home-cooked meals. It was also tough to stay healthy with irregular eating times.</p>

            <h4>Advice for New Students</h4>
            <p class="ambassador-advice">"Be open to making friends. You're not the only one feeling alone, and connecting with others makes a big difference. Also, don't forget to take breaks from studying."</p>

            <h4>Favourite Canadian Experience</h4>
            <p>Watching baseball games at the Rogers Centre. The stadium is huge, and the fans' energy makes it unforgettable!</p>

        <!-- Ridhima -->
        <article class="ambassador-profile" data-reveal>
          <div class="ambassador-profile-image pencil-sketch">
            <img src="/images/ambassador-ridhima.jpg" alt="Ridhima, Student Ambassador at York University" />
          </div>
          <div class="ambassador-profile-content">
            <h3>Ridhima</h3>
            <p class="ambassador-meta">York University · Commerce (Finance) · 3rd Year</p>
            <p class="ambassador-origin">Originally from India</p>

            <h4>Ridhima's Journey</h4>
            <p>I came to Canada to pursue my Bachelor of Commerce degree at York University. My journey has been filled with challenges, from adjusting to a new culture and climate to building a community, but it has also been incredibly rewarding. I've become involved in different student leadership and ambassador roles.</p>

            <h4>Why I Became an Ambassador</h4>
            <p>I know how overwhelming it can feel moving to a new country. I wanted to help make that transition smoother for others, and to share the lessons I learned along the way.</p>

            <h4>Biggest Challenge</h4>
            <p>Adjusting to Canadian winters, figuring out housing and transit, and building a social circle in a completely new environment.</p>

            <h4>Advice for New Students</h4>
            <p class="ambassador-advice">"Take small steps every day to step outside your comfort zone — whether it's joining a club, attending a campus event, or introducing yourself to someone new."</p>

            <h4>Favourite Canadian Experience</h4>
            <p>Visiting Montreal. The architecture is so amazing and the nightlife there is fantastic.</p>

        <!-- Tien -->
        <article class="ambassador-profile" data-reveal>
          <div class="ambassador-profile-image pencil-sketch">
            <img src="/images/ambassador-tien.jpg" alt="Tien, Student Ambassador at York University" />

            <h3>Tien</h3>
            <p class="ambassador-meta">York University · Statistics · 3rd Year</p>
            <p class="ambassador-origin">Originally from Vietnam</p>

            <h4>Tien's Journey</h4>
            <p>I came to Canada to pursue my studies in Statistics at York University. Currently, I hold several roles, including an internship as a Risk Analyst, as well as positions as a Research Assistant, Teaching Assistant, and Recruitment & Campus Ambassador. I also serve on the International Student Advisory Board.</p>

            <h4>Why I Became an Ambassador</h4>
            <p>I want to help international students feel welcomed and supported. When I first came to Canada, I found it very difficult to adjust to a completely new culture. I hope to support new students so their transition can be smoother.</p>

            <h4>Biggest Challenge</h4>
            <p>Understanding how finances work in Canada — setting up a bank account, getting a credit card, creating a SIN number, learning about taxes, and understanding what I needed to apply for a job.</p>

            <h4>Advice for New Students</h4>
            <p class="ambassador-advice">"Don't be afraid to ask for help or opportunities. Support won't come to you automatically — you'll only receive it when you reach out to others."</p>

            <h4>Favourite Canadian Experience</h4>
            <p>Queen's Park in downtown Toronto, where I enjoy hiking and then exploring different nearby restaurants.</p>

            <h3>Fernand</h3>
            <p class="ambassador-meta">Toronto Metropolitan University · Computer Science · 2nd Year</p>
            <p class="ambassador-origin">Originally from Venezuela</p>

            <h4>Fernand's Journey</h4>
            <p>I came to Canada in 2022 with my family as immigrants due to the situation in our home country. Moving here meant starting from scratch, adapting to a new environment, and learning a new language while building a life in a completely different society. My journey has taught me resilience, determination, and adaptability.</p>

            <h4>Why I Became an Ambassador</h4>
            <p>I want to share my experience as an international student and help others feel less alone during their transition. I want to make the process of adaptation easier for new students. Just like I wish it had been for me.</p>

            <h4>Biggest Challenge</h4>
            <p>Adjusting to cold weather, finding housing, and learning how to manage things like banking, transit, and continuing my education.</p>

            <h4>Advice for New Students</h4>
            <p class="ambassador-advice">"Be mindful of the actual time you will need to spend on each of your courses. Just because the curriculum says you should take 5 subjects doesn't mean you have to. You can start with 3 or 4 courses."</p>

            <h4>Favourite Canadian Experience</h4>
            <p>My favorite Canadian food is Poutine, and my favorite place is Niagara Falls!</p>

            <p class="ambassador-meta">Western University (Ivey) · MSc Business Analytics</p>
            <p class="ambassador-origin">Graduate Student</p>

            <h4>Shafaq's Journey</h4>
            <p>As an international student, I know firsthand how challenging it can be to navigate a new country while balancing academics and settling in. Sharing my own experiences, from managing housing and transit to adapting to academic life, can truly make a difference for newcomers.</p>

            <h4>Why I Became an Ambassador</h4>
            <p>I became a Crestway Global Student Ambassador to help make that journey smoother for others. I believe sharing my own experiences can truly make a difference for newcomers.</p>

            <h4>Biggest Challenge</h4>
            <p>Adapting to the cold weather, figuring out Toronto's transit system, finding affordable housing, keeping up with the fast-paced academic environment, and experiencing culture shock while learning to settle into a completely new lifestyle.</p>

            <h4>Advice for New Students</h4>
            <p class="ambassador-advice">"Try to find people who help you grow, whether they're classmates, mentors, or friends. Don't hesitate to seek help if you're struggling — you're never alone in this journey."</p>

            <h4>Favourite Canadian Experience</h4>
            <p>Poutine is such a classic comfort dish! My family trip to Brockville stands out — taking the 1000 Islands cruise and hiking through Algonquin Park trails in fall were unforgettable moments.</p>
