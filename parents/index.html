            <summary>Will my child be safe in Canada?</summary>
            <p>Canada is among the safest countries for international students. We add an extra layer: verified housing, known contacts in emergencies, and advisors who check in regularly. We treat your child's safety as if they were our own.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>How do I know what's really happening if I'm so far away?</summary>
            <p>Our monthly reports cover academics, health, social life, and emotional wellbeing. We include specifics: grades, doctor visits, activities, mood. If something is wrong, we tell you immediately. No surprises.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>My child is very independent. Will they feel watched?</summary>

          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>What if my child gets sick?</strong></summary>
            <p>We help them register with a family doctor, understand their insurance, and navigate the healthcare system. For serious issues, we accompany them to appointments and keep you informed every step of the way.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>How do you handle the language barrier?</summary>
            <p>Our team includes Mandarin-speaking advisors. We can explain complex situations—academic, medical, legal—in your language. We also help your child improve their English for daily independence.</p>
